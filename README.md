# Power Loom

Power Loom is a Gradle plugin made to supplement Fabric Loom, providing some
quality-of-life improving features for Fabric mod development. It can generate and
modify `fabric.mod.json` files, download other mods into your dev environment for
testing, and setup publishing to both CurseForge and Modrinth simultaneously.

**This project is not finished. See the feature list for implemented vs planned
features.**
